Write a Python program that outputs a list of tuples where each element contains 3 integers that represent an interval of time. The 3 integers represent the following: 1) The start time of the interval 2) The end time of the interval 3) How many intervals in the original list of intervals overlap between this time. The output is supposed to be a representation of how many intervals are overlapping at each point in time throughout the timespan (represented as intervals) and track all changes. The result should be a list of tuples that are ordered by the start time and that don't overlap. For example, passing in [[1, 3], [2, 4], [5, 7], [6, 8]] should result in an output of [(1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 2), (3, 4, 1), (4, 5, 0), (5, 6, 1), (6, 7, 2), (7, 8, 1)]..\n","\n","Your output code must satisfy these tests:\n","import heapq\n","\n","assert overlapping_intervals([[1, 3], [2, 4], [5, 7], [6, 8]]) == [(1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 2), (3, 4, 1), (4, 5, 0), (5, 6, 1), (6, 7, 2), (7, 8, 1)]\n","assert overlapping_intervals([[5, 7], [6, 8], [1, 3], [2, 4]]) == [(1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 2), (3, 4, 1), (4, 5, 0), (5, 6, 1), (6, 7, 2), (7, 8, 1)]\n","assert overlapping_intervals([[5, 8], [6, 7], [1, 3], [2, 4]]) == [(1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 2), (3, 4, 1), (4, 5, 0), (5, 6, 1), (6, 7, 2), (7, 8, 1)]\n","assert overlapping_intervals([[5, 12], [8, 10], [6, 9], [1, 3], [2, 4]]) == [(1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 2), (3, 4, 1), (4, 5, 0), (5, 6, 1), (6, 8, 2), (8, 9, 3), (9, 10, 2), (10, 12, 1)]\n","assert overlapping_intervals([[5, 14], [8, 12], [6, 10], [1, 3], [2, 4]]) == [(1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 2), (3, 4, 1), (4, 5, 0), (5, 6, 1), (6, 8, 2), (8, 10, 3), (10, 12, 2), (12, 14, 1)]\n","\n","\n","PROPOSED SOLUTION:\n","Here is a Python solution using a min-heap to keep track of the intervals and a counter to keep track of the number of overlapping intervals:\n","\n","```python\n","import heapq\n","\n","def overlapping_intervals(intervals):\n","    # Sort the intervals by start time\n","    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n","    \n","    # Initialize the heap and the counter\n","    heap = []\n","    counter = 0\n","    \n","    # Initialize the result list\n","    result = []\n","    \n","    # Iterate over the intervals\n","    for interval in intervals:\n","        # If the heap is not empty and the start time of the current interval is greater than or equal to the end time of the top interval in the heap, pop the top interval from the heap\n","        while heap and interval[0] >= heap[0][1]:\n","            heapq.heappop(heap)\n","        \n","        # If the heap is not empty, increment the counter\n","        if heap:\n","            counter += 1\n","        \n","        # Add the current interval to the heap\n","        heapq.heappush(heap, interval)\n","        \n","        # Add the start and end times of the current interval along with the counter to the result list\n","        result.append((interval[0], interval[1], counter))\n","    \n","    # Return the result list\n","    return result\n","```\n","\n","This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting of the intervals and the use of a min-heap.
