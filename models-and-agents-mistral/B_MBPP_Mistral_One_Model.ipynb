      "  - `_*` matches zero or more sequences of an underscore and one or more lowercase letters.\n",
      "\n",
      "  - `$` asserts the end of a line.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The function `re.search(pattern, text)` searches the `text` for the first location where the `pattern` produces a match, and returns a corresponding match object if found. If no match is found, it returns `None`.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The `if` statement checks if the `re.search()` function found a match. If it did, it returns the string `'Found a match!'`. Otherwise, it returns `'Not matched!'`.\n",

The time complexity is O(2^n) due to the generation of all subsequences, where n is the length of the input array. However, the actual time taken can be less than this in the worst case, because the function `no_of_subsequences` stops counting as soon as it encounters a subsequence with product greater than or equal to k. The space complexity is also O(2^n) due to storing all subsequences.\n",
